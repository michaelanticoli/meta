## Overview

As Brand Strategist for Diageo in 2021, I developed a strategic campaign connecting Buchanan's whisky with football (soccer) culture and Latino communities.  Football represents a powerful cultural touchpoint for Latino audiences, serving as a source of pride, community connection, and passionate engagement.

The campaign created authentic storytelling that celebrated Latino football culture while positioning Buchanan's as the premium spirit for celebrating victories, watching matches with friends and family, and honoring the passion that football inspires.

## Key Achievements

- Developed culturally resonant campaign messaging connecting whisky with football passion
- Created authentic storytelling that celebrated Latino football culture
- Implemented cross-platform campaign strategy driving brand awareness
- Enhanced brand connection with target demographic through cultural insights
- Successfully positioned premium whisky within football celebration contexts

## Philosophy

Football isn't just a sport in Latino culture—it's a communal experience, a source of pride, and a celebration ritual.  Buchanan's becomes part of that celebration when positioned authentically as the premium choice for commemorating victories and sharing moments of passion with loved ones.
