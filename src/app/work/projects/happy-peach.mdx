## Overview

As Founder & Cultural Strategist, I created Happy Peach Skin Co., a revolutionary men's grooming brand specializing in buttock care and waxing services.  This self-created brand was founded in Los Angeles in 2020 to address an untapped white space in the men's grooming market while challenging traditional masculinity norms.

The brand combines sophisticated semiotics research with premium positioning strategy to create an inclusive community that promotes progressive masculinity and authentic self-care for men aged 18-45.

## Key Achievements

- Created **cultural framework challenging traditional masculinity norms**
- Built inclusive brand community promoting **progressive self-care narratives** for men aged 18-45
- Established new category in men's grooming focused on previously taboo body areas

## Philosophy

Modern masculinity is evolving, and men deserve access to grooming services that were traditionally unavailable or stigmatized. Happy Peach Skin Co. creates a judgment-free space where self-care is normalized, not feminized.

## Brand Positioning

The brand balances premium service quality with an approachable, slightly playful tone that reduces anxiety around sensitive topics.  The name "Happy Peach" uses fruit imagery to make the focus area feel natural and approachable.

## Technologies & Methodologies Used

- **Cultural Innovation** frameworks
- **Semiotic Brand Strategy**
- **Progressive Masculinity** research
- **Community Psychology** principles
- Cultural anthropology analysis
- Premium brand positioning
