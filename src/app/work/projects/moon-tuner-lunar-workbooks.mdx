## Overview

Moon Tuner is a series of personalized lunar workbooks developed in collaboration with Ang Bocca between 2015-2019. Each workbook is customized to an individual's birth chart, providing month-by-month guidance for working with lunar cycles through journaling prompts, ritual suggestions, and reflective practices.

## Key Features

- **Monthly Lunar Tracking**: Visual calendars showing new moons, full moons, and quarter phases with corresponding energetic themes
- **Reflection + Ritual Spreads**: Two-page layouts pairing introspective prompts with practical ritual actions
- **Custom Glyphs and Iconography**: Original visual system representing lunar phases, astrological symbols, and elemental correspondences

## Design Approach

The workbooks balance accessibility with depth, offering both beginners and experienced practitioners meaningful entry points.  The layout emphasizes whitespace and clarity, with hand-drawn elements that create an intimate, personal feeling.

## Technologies Used

## Outcome
