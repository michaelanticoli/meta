## Overview

The Seasonal Spellwriting Series, developed in collaboration with Amon Ajari between 2019-2022, is a four-volume collection exploring ritual creation, intention-setting, and creative magic through seasonal lenses. Each volume corresponds to a season and its associated elemental energy, providing readers with frameworks for developing their own personalized ritual practices.

## Key Features

- **Seasonal Structure**: Four volumes (Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn) each exploring themes of reflection, growth, manifestation, and release
- **Elemental Correspondences**: Integration of earth, air, fire, and water symbolism with seasonal cycles
- **Framework-Based Approach**: Step-by-step methods for crafting effective, personally meaningful rituals
- **Creative Exercises**: Prompts and practices that blend writing, visualization, and embodied action

## Content Design

Each volume balances theoretical context with practical application.  Readers learn the underlying principles of ritual construction—intention, timing, symbolism, action—and then apply these principles through guided exercises.

## Technologies Used

- **Writing & Editing**: Collaborative document workflows
- **Layout Design**: Canva and InDesign for print-ready formatting
- **Distribution**: Self-published through print-on-demand services

## Philosophy

The series operates from the premise that ritual is a form of creative expression and that "spellwriting" is fundamentally about clarifying intention and enacting it through symbolic action. This approach makes ritual accessible to people from diverse spiritual backgrounds.

## Outcome

The Seasonal Spellwriting Series has provided readers with a flexible, empowering approach to ritual practice.  It demonstrates Michael's ability to design educational frameworks that balance structure with creative freedom.
