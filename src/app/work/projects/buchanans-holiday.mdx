## Overview

As Cultural Strategy Lead for Diageo during Q4 2021, I developed a strategic cultural unification campaign that highlighted the beautiful diversity of Christmas traditions across Hispanic and Latino communities while emphasizing shared values of family and togetherness.

The campaign successfully balanced celebrating cultural differences with creating unified brand messaging that resonated across generations and cultural backgrounds, resulting in significant increases in brand affinity and purchase intent during the critical holiday season.

## Key Achievements

- **Developed cultural anthropological framework** identifying **12 distinct holiday celebration patterns** within Latino communities
- Created unified brand messaging that celebrated diversity while emphasizing shared values
- **Implemented cross-generational storytelling strategy** resulting in **65% increase in holiday season brand affinity**
- Achieved **40% lift in purchase intent** through authentic cultural representation
- Successfully bridged traditional and modern holiday celebration approaches across age groups
- Established Buchanan's as a culturally-aware brand that understands and respects Latino diversity

## Philosophy

True cultural unification doesn't erase differences—it celebrates them while finding the common threads that connect us all.

## Technologies & Methodologies Used

- **Cultural Anthropology** research frameworks
- **Strategic Unification** methodology
- **Cross-Generational Marketing** approaches
