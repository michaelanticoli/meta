## Overview

Red Casket Club is a music and persona project that explores the intersection of vintage surf rock, noir jazz, and psychedelic atmosphere. The project creates a cohesive sonic and visual world that feels simultaneously nostalgic and unsettling, like a haunted tiki bar on a forgotten island.

## Sonic Identity

The Red Casket Club sound is characterized by:
- **Reverb-drenched guitar**:  Surf rock influences with darker, more mysterious tones
- **Vintage organ and Rhodes**: Lounge and jazz textures with a sinister edge
- **Cinematic percussion**: Tribal rhythms and unexpected sound design elements
- **Analog warmth**: Production aesthetic emphasizing tape saturation

## Visual World

The project's visual identity draws from:
- Mid-century tiki culture and exotica album art
- Film noir aesthetics and vintage crime paperbacks
- Occult symbolism and mystical iconography
- 1960s psychedelic poster design

## Technologies Used

- **Logic Pro**: Primary DAW for composition and production
- **Virtual Instruments**: Vintage keyboard emulations, guitar amp simulators
- **Analog Hardware**: Select outboard gear for warmth and character
- **Visual Design**:  Photoshop and Illustrator for cover art and promotional materials

## Creative Philosophy

Red Casket Club operates in the liminal space between genres and eras, creating music that feels both familiar and strange. The project asks:  What if surf rock took a darker turn? What if lounge music soundtracked psychological thrillers?

## Outcome

Red Casket Club has developed a cult following among listeners who appreciate genre-blending, atmospheric music with a strong visual identity.
