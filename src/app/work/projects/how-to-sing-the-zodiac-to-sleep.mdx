## Overview

*How to Sing the Zodiac to Sleep* is a 12-volume series (currently in development) that combines astrology, attachment theory, and nervous system science to help readers better understand and support the people in their lives. Each book is dedicated to a single zodiac sign and explores what that sign needs to feel safe, seen, and emotionally regulated.

## Key Features

- **Sign-Specific Nervous System Profiles**:  Detailed exploration of how each sign experiences stress, safety, and emotional overwhelm
- **Attachment-Informed Approach**: Integration of attachment theory principles with astrological archetypes
- **Practical De-escalation Techniques**: Concrete strategies for supporting someone in distress based on their sign's core needs
- **Boundary Guidance**: How to create safety for a sign while maintaining your own boundaries and wellbeing

## Methodology

Each volume follows a consistent structure:

1. **Understanding the Sign**: Core motivations, fears, and emotional patterns
2. **Nervous System Landscape**: How this sign experiences safety, threat, and regulation
3. **Creating Safety**: Environmental, relational, and communicative approaches
4. **De-escalation Strategies**: What to do when this sign is activated or overwhelmed
5. **Boundaries and Care**: How to support without depleting yourself

## Technologies Used

- **Research & Writing**: Google Docs, Notion databases for organizing research
- **Framework Architecture**: Notion for building repeatable structures across all 12 volumes
- **Design (Planned)**: InDesign or Canva for final layout

## Philosophy

The series rejects judgment and pathologization, instead approaching each sign with curiosity and compassion. It's based on the belief that everyone has core emotional needs, and when those needs are understood and met, relationships become more peaceful and connected.

## Current Status

The framework and structure are complete, with several volumes in active development. The series represents a fusion of Michael's expertise in astrology, systems thinking, and emotional intelligence.

## Intended Impact

This series aims to give readers practical tools for creating more harmonious relationships by understanding the emotional architecture of the people they care about.
