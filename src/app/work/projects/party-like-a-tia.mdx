## Overview

As Cultural Strategy Lead & Campaign Architect for Diageo in 2022, I developed an innovative responsible drinking campaign that leveraged cultural anthropology to transform traditional safety messaging into empowering cultural pride.  The campaign centered on the 'Tia' (aunt) archetype—a beloved figure in Latino culture who provides guidance, care, and wisdom at family gatherings.

By reframing responsible drinking through positive behavioral modeling rather than harm-reduction messaging, the campaign achieved unprecedented engagement rates and dramatically shifted consumer sentiment around alcohol safety messaging.

## Key Achievements

- **Developed strategic cultural framework** identifying 'Tia' archetype as authentic Latino leadership model
- **Transformed traditional harm-reduction messaging** into positive behavioral modeling, increasing engagement by **180%**
- Created **three-pillar strategy (Safety, Simpatía, Simple)** that resonated across demographic segments
- Achieved **50% reduction in negative sentiment** around responsible drinking messaging while increasing brand trust by **35%**
- Pioneered new approach to public health messaging through cultural archetypes

## The Three Pillars

Pillar 1: The Warm Welcome (Inclusivity & Connection Beyond Alcohol)
The Core Philosophy:
This pillar relates to the deep Hispanic cultural values of inclusivity ("simpatia") and community. It posits that the primary purpose of a gathering is connection, bonding, and purposeful interaction, not intoxication.

The "La Tia" Perspective:
La Tia’s house is open to everyone; family extends beyond blood relatives to include friends and neighbors. Her goal is harmony and togetherness. She ensures that socializing is about the people present, creating an environment where empathy and inclusion are paramount.

Actionable Definition for Buchanan’s:

Shift the Goal: Reframe the "fiesta" away from drinking as the main event and toward the opportunity to bond and build trust.
Inclusive Hosting: Promote the idea that a great host ensures everyone feels welcome and engaged, regardless of whether they are drinking alcohol.
Cultural Anchor: Leverage the natural Hispanic inclination toward community to validate that meaningful connection is the party, reducing the pressure to overconsume alcohol to have fun.

Pillar 2: The Abundant Table (Food as the Cultural Anchor)
The Core Philosophy:
Food is identified in the text as the "social adhesive," the "anchor," and the centerpiece of Hispanic community life. It is a vehicle for heritage, joy, nostalgia, and abundance.

The "La Tia" Perspective:
For La Tia, showing love means feeding people abundantly. A celebration without a massive spread of food is unthinkable. She uses food to keep people at the table longer for sobremesa (the socializing after a meal), naturally slowing down the pace of the evening and shifting the focus away from just drinking.

Actionable Definition for Buchanan’s:

Displace Alcohol as the Centerpiece: Actively promote food and culinary heritage as the primary way to celebrate and honor richness of culture.
The Role of the Host: Encourage hosts to focus their energy on generosity through culinary abundance (including delicious non-alcoholic options like aguas frescas) rather than just keeping glasses full.
Promote Sobremesa: Champion the tradition of lingering at the table for conversation as the ultimate positive social experience.

Pillar 3: The Collective Caretaker (Empowered Responsibility & Familism)
The Core Philosophy:
This pillar redefines "responsible drinking" not as an individual restriction, but as a collective cultural value. It taps into "familism"—the high value placed on taking care of family and helping others as a key marker of success.

The "La Tia" Perspective:
La Tia wants everyone to "brillemos" (shine), but she also demands they "ubícate" (orient themselves/act right). She embodies watchful care. She empowers her community to take authority over their lives while instilling a deep sense of responsibility for the safety and well-being of the entire group.

Actionable Definition for Buchanan’s:

Reframe Responsibility: Move away from preachy messages of restriction. Instead, position responsible behavior as a way of honoring the family/community and building trust.
Empowerment Language: Use positive, empowering messaging (like "brillemos") that encourages individuals to step into their "mighty roles" as caretakers of their friends and loved ones.
Safety as Caring: Looking out for each other and ensuring a safe environment isn't being a "party pooper"; it is the ultimate expression of Hispanic loyalty and support.
## Philosophy

Public health messaging fails when it feels preachy or punitive. By centering the beloved Tia archetype—someone who guides with love, not judgment—we transformed responsible drinking from a lecture into an act of cultural pride and family care.

## Technologies & Methodologies Used

- **Cultural Anthropology** frameworks
- **Behavioral Psychology** principles
- **Archetype Strategy** development
- **Positive Messaging** frameworks
- Cultural semiotics research
- Consumer sentiment analysis

## Outcome

The campaign fundamentally shifted how audiences perceive responsible drinking messaging, proving that cultural authenticity and positive framing can achieve public health goals more effectively than fear-based approaches.
