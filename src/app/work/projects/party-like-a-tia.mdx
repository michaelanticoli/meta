## Overview

As Cultural Strategy Lead & Campaign Architect for Diageo in 2022, I developed an innovative responsible drinking campaign that leveraged cultural anthropology to transform traditional safety messaging into empowering cultural pride.  The campaign centered on the 'Tia' (aunt) archetype—a beloved figure in Latino culture who provides guidance, care, and wisdom at family gatherings.

By reframing responsible drinking through positive behavioral modeling rather than harm-reduction messaging, the campaign achieved unprecedented engagement rates and dramatically shifted consumer sentiment around alcohol safety messaging.

## Key Achievements

- **Developed strategic cultural framework** identifying 'Tia' archetype as authentic Latino leadership model
- **Transformed traditional harm-reduction messaging** into positive behavioral modeling, increasing engagement by **180%**
- Created **three-pillar strategy (Safety, Simpatía, Simple)** that resonated across demographic segments
- Achieved **50% reduction in negative sentiment** around responsible drinking messaging while increasing brand trust by **35%**
- Pioneered new approach to public health messaging through cultural archetypes

## The Three Pillars

1. **Safety**: Practical tips delivered with warmth and care
2. **Simpatía**: Cultural value of maintaining harmony and pleasant social interactions
3. **Simple**: Easy-to-remember, actionable guidance

## Philosophy

Public health messaging fails when it feels preachy or punitive. By centering the beloved Tia archetype—someone who guides with love, not judgment—we transformed responsible drinking from a lecture into an act of cultural pride and family care.

## Technologies & Methodologies Used

- **Cultural Anthropology** frameworks
- **Behavioral Psychology** principles
- **Archetype Strategy** development
- **Positive Messaging** frameworks
- Cultural semiotics research
- Consumer sentiment analysis

## Outcome

The campaign fundamentally shifted how audiences perceive responsible drinking messaging, proving that cultural authenticity and positive framing can achieve public health goals more effectively than fear-based approaches.
